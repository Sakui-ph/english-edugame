# English Edugame

A visual novel whose purpose is to supplement two specific learning outcomes:

1. Lower Order Learning Outcome: Remember and apply arguments
   for a particular stance when they are identified in a scenario or situation.
2. Higher Order Learning Outcome: Organize arguments as ‘for’,
   ‘against’, or ‘irrelevant’ upon being given a specific scenario and situation.

This project was completed for our thesis.

The visual novel is used for narrative purposes, and after it comes small minigames (learning outcome mechanics) which are meant to facilitate learning.
