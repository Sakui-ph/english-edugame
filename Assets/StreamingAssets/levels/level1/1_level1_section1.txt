Anjelo "Well, You see Ezekiel is the one who found her." 
"He was feeding stray cats at the back of the canteen and"
"this specific white cat didn’t want to leave." 
"She came back everyday, so he fed her everyday." 
Anjelo [0:shock] "Eventually the other students found out and started feeding her too!" 
"People started calling her Ming Ming" 
Anjelo [0:happy] "then lots of us got attached, so they asked the school to adopt her!"
