narrator  "Both Sammy and Tris roll their eyes." 
Anjelo "So, the first thing you need to know is that Sammy and Tris have been close since Grade 1!"
"They tell each other pretty much everything." 
"But then, Sammy recently started liking this girl."
"And so he thought it was a good idea to tell Tris about it." 
"Sammy told Tris not to tell anyone but she knew Sammy would never try to confess to his crush..." 
"so she decided to do it for him!" 
"She wrote a fake love letter and gave it to his crush while pretending it was from Sammy."
