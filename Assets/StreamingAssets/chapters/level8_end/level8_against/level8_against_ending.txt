narrator  "You decided to let Sammy stay on the team!" 
"Because of your decision," 
"Sammy now chooses to be more conscious of what he says" 
"and how he says it." 
"It’s slow progress but, eventually," 
"Sammy gets back to his old, not toxic self." 
"The team is back, and they’re stronger than ever!" 
"Thankful for what you did for them," 
"you make a new group of friends and become an honorary member of the team!"
